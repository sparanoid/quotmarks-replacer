Quotmarks Replacer disables wptexturize function that keeps all quotation marks and suspension points in half-width form.

== Description ==

Quotmarks Replacer disables `wptexturize` function that keeps all quotation marks and suspension points in half-width form. This plugin also works fine with multisite enabled WordPress (aka. WordPress Mu).

More information please visit my [site](http://sparanoid.com/work/quotmarks-replacer/).

Quotmarks Replacer 通過禁用 `wptexturize` 函數，解決 WordPress 自動將半形的單引號、雙引號和省略號轉換爲全形標點的問題。使後台輸入的標點格式與前台讀者瀏覽的標點格式保持一致。並且對 multisite 多站點（WordPress Mu）有良好的支持

**Reviews（用戶評價）**

> 我──一個網絡民工──當然有人會覺得這是謙虛，終於擁有了強悍的標點符號插件──也可能是世界上最棒的！我可以這樣雙引號“”，也可以這樣""，還可以這樣"──無論是哪一樣，都是最自由的表達！ ── 和菜頭
